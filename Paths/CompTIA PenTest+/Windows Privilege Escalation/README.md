# Windows Privilege Escalation
In this room we will learn the fundamentals of Windows privilege escalation techniques, according to TryHackMe's PenTest+ Path.

## Task 1 - Introduction

In penetration testing, we will often have access to certain Windows hosts with an <abbr title="Users with limited access, typically only able to access their own files and folders, with no means to perform administrative tasks on a host.">_unprivileged user_</abbr>. An unprivileged user's credentials have no access to administrative privileges, and thus a pen tester lacks such controls over the target.

While not necessarily required, the writer of the room suggests the following rooms as 'skill-refreshers' or prerequisites: [Windows Fundamentals Module](https://tryhackme.com/module/windows-fundamentals) and/or the [Hacking Windows Module](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-windows-1).

## Task 2 - Windows Privilege Escalation _an overview_

Privilege escalation essentially entails leveraging existing access to a host as "User A", an unprivileged user, to gain access to "User B", which holds desired administrative rights, by abusing a weakness in the target system. While this situation is ideal, it may often be the case where "User B" is a necessary step in further escalating into other unprivileged accounts before reaching the desired "User _n_" and gaining admin privileges.

Such access can sometimes be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets, carelessly left unsecured by a user. That said, depending on the situation, some of the following weaknesses may need to be explored:

- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
- Excessive privileges assigned to a given account
- Vulnerable Software
- Missing Windows security patches

### Windows Users
Primarily categorized into one of the following groups:

| Administrators Group | Typically the most privileged users, capable of making changes to any system configuration parameter and access mostly any file in the system |
| :--------------: | :---: |
| Standard Users or *Users* Group | Limited access to system resources and tasks. Typically no abilities to make permanent or essential changes to the system and only have access to permitted files |

Further, certain accounts are built-in and used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:

| SYSTEM / LocalSystem | Account used by the OS to perform internal tasks, with full access to files and resources on the host and higher privileges than administrators |
| :-----: | :---: |
| Local Service | Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. Uses anonymous connections on the network |
| Network Service | Default account to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. Uses computer credentials to authenticate through the network |
