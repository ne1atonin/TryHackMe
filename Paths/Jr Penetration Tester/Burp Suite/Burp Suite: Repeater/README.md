# Burp Suite: Repeater

## Task 1 - Introduction

In this room we explore the advanced capabilities of the Burp framework with the Repeater tool, including manipulation and resending captured requests as well as other funcitions, with practical examples and a couple of challenges to complete. Some of the tasks are theoretical in nature and I definitely recommend reading through as they provide detailed and easy to read overview of the tool's purpose and functionality.

Q: N/A

Let's GO!

## Task 2 - What is Repeater?

- Repeater allows us to modify and resend intercepted requests to a target of our choosing. We capture requests in the proxy, manipulate, send - wash, rinse, repeat - as needed. Requests can also be created
  manually from scratch (similar to CL tool cURL).

- In Repeater, we can edit and resend requests *repeatedly* until we obtain a response that helps us manually explore and test endpoint responses.
