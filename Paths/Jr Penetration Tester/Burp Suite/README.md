# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is The industry standard tool for web application hacking and any web penetration test. It's generally included in Kali or Parrot, but can be downloaded from [PortSwigger.net](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload). 

### This module was recently updated and is part of the Jr Penetration Tester Path. The module includes five progressive rooms and I am getting a lot out of it, even though I've already learned the basics of Burp in the original module. It's a nicely done walkthrough of the tool, and I'm enjoying going through the tasks.

> Note: I've also been going through the [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) Introductory Learning Path, which introduces security concepts by topic, has a lot of labs and is completely free.
