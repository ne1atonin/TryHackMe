### Documenting My Learning - A Continuous Process

* * *

In some cases, I did the rooms or tasks without taking notes! Or at least I thought I did :); so, please note that I am posting these as I complete them, especially given that I often can't finish in one sitting. Also, for quite a few I am re-doing the rooms in order to create the write-ups.

I hope my learning process translates well. I am passionate about what I am learning and going through this process, writing things out...really helps me, and I hope it eventually helps someone else. I'm finding my intuition and curiosity growing, and my hunger to learn is insatiable.

_Note - In some cases I have completed rooms and corresponding writeups over the course of a few hours. In some cases, I did not start the writeup until being partially through the room. In many cases I made an outline but forgot to do the writeup. Also, and especially with respect to some of the Paths, I'd get stuck and complete the rooms out of order. Please forgive any incomplete writeups, as I like to keep up the habit of sharing as I go._
