### Documenting My Learning - A WIP. 
* * *
In some cases, I did the rooms or tasks without taking notes! Or at least I thought I did :); so, please note that I am posting these as I complete them, especially given that I often can't finish in one sitting. Also, for quite a few I am re-doing the rooms in order to create the write-ups.

I hope my learning process translates well. I am passionate about learning and going through this process, writing things out...really helps me, and I hope it eventually helps someone else.

_Note - I lost the images associated with some of the rooms I had previously completed. I am currently building this repo back up from scratch so I apologize for all of the bad links. It is a work in progress._
