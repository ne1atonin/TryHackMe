# Burp Suite: The Basics

> Note: This is Part One of the newly updated Burp Suite Module and part of the [Jr Penetration Tester Certificate Path](https://tryhackme.com/paths)

## Task 1 - Introduction:

The focus of Part One is to walk through the basics of the Burp Suite web application security testing framework.  This introduction revolves aruond the following:

- A Thorough Introduction to Burp Suite
- A Comprehensive Overview of the Various Tools Within the Framework
- Detailed Guidance on the Process of Installing Burp
- Navigation and Configuration of Burp Suite

This room also introduces the Burp Proxy, which is the core of the framework. The emphasis here is primarily on theoritical concepts, and subsequent rooms in this module will become more practical. I found it extremely helpful to go through this updated module (even though I completed the prior verson), as it actually helped me logically break down whats happening.

I may not provide a full writeup of parts of the room since it's mostly theory, but will try to provide an outline once I complete the full module.
