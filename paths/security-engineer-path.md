# Security Engineer

Security engineers serve to design and implement secure systems, networks and software, with an understanding of the threats and risks an organization faces. We know that security incidents are increasingly common and continue to grow in sophistication. In addition, bad guys are increasingly interrelated with well-funded sources. Thus it is vital for organizations to proactively harden their defenses. A security engineer is critical to an organizations security and defense infrastructure, while also contributing to incident response. This path on TryHackMe aims to provide an understanding of various elements of Security Engineering and in turn, gives us a well-rounded perspective, regardless of which area of cybersecurity we operate in.
